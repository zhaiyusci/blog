[kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) is a free software used to edit videos.  Although there is 'kde' in its name, it can be used on Windows.

The [official download page](https://kdenlive.org/en/download/) has provided a version for Windows.  However, it does not work at the first step: including your raw videos in the clip bin.  

This problem occurs because provided zip package does not place the ffmpeg library correctly.  Although on the download page it says, and I quote here 'Now, you donâ€™t need to do anything more to set up. To run Kdenlive, you just have to unzip the downloaded Kdenlive version, and start Kdenlive from kdenlive.exe in kdenlive-windows folder.'

Here is the full steps to make it work:
* Download the `Kdenlive-xx.yy.zz-w64.zip` package [here](https://files.kde.org/kdenlive/release/Kdenlive-18.04.1d-w64.zip) (the lastest version should be download from the official page).
* Unzip `Kdenlive-xx.yy.zz-w64.zip` to `C:\kdenlive\`
* Download ffmpeg library [here](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/static/ffmpeg-20180726-bce4da8-win64-static.zip)
* Open the ffmpeg zip package and drop 'n' drop to `C:\kdenlive\`.  After that you can see the `bin` directory appears in `C:\kdenlive\`.

Now double click the `kdenlive.exe` try to load a video in the bin.  All format supported by ffmpeg should now be supported by kdenlive.  

Enjoy!

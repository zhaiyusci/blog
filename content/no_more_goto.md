If you are working on scientific calculation, you must know FORTRAN.  Hence you will meet a lot of `GOTO`.

I JUST HATE IT.

`GOTO` looks like interchange.  Well, it is good for crossroad.  But frankly speaking, I do not know how to drive :-(.

I read blogs saying that, if you are a new guy in a group, **DO NOT REFACTORING THE OLD UGLY FORTRAN CODES**.  Although I am not new here, I prefer let the code be *as it was*.  However, some guys should know that FORTRAN is not popular any more in certain situations and I think it time that we should try to use more elegant languages, like the new C++(well, too complicated) or python(but I dislike it).

There is [a webpage](http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Modernizing+Old+Fortran) which told us how to do 'modernization' to your old FORTRAN code.  I will read it carefully and try it.

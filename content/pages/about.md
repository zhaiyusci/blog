I am Yu ZHAI, and 'ZHAI' is my lastname. 


I am now a Ph. D. candidate in Institute of Theoretical Chemistry, Jilin University, China.  I work with [Prof. Hui Li](http://huiligroup.org/).  

I am really fond of science.  Besides, I like music.  I like almost all kind of art.

I hope that you can be friends of mine.  So if you have any question about what I write here, feel free to contact me using this mail address `me(at)zhaiyusci.net`.
